Music Genre Classification is performed using PCA and without using PCA to understand how PCA works and helps for a good classification. 
Logistic Regression is used for Multi-class classification.

Classification using PCA is performed first and then classification without PCA is performed to understand how the model's classification performance degraded compared to the model with PCA.

Some questions and answers are added in the markdown cells for recalling the learning and for self-validation of the work.

There are null values in some data points of target column. 
The developed Logistic Regression model with PCA is used for predicting those unknown target classes and then filled those null values with the corresponding predictions.
